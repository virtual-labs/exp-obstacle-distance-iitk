Obstacle is something which blocks your path. Roadblocks etc. could serve as artificial obstacles while a mental block is a good example of a non physical obstacle which is a more potent force than any of the obstacles mentioned above. However, when we are dealing with dislocations we are operating at a micron scale and obstacles to dislocation motion could be precipitates, grain boundaries or other dislocations as well. Obstacle need not be some physical object blocking the path it could be a force generated due to some reaction at some totally different location. Just as we go around, over or through an obstacle, dislocations might as well take one of these paths to overcome the obstacles. The obstacle size, distribution, etc. effect the energy required to overcome the obstacle. A decrease in obstacle distance leads to an increase in the number of obstacles encountered by dislocations during their motion and since energy is required to overcome an obstacle higher the number of obstacles more is the energy required to overcome these obstacles. This leads to lowering of creep deformation since a major portion of the deformation energy is consumed in overcoming of the obstacles.<br>
