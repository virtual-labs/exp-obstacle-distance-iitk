1.In this experiment random numbers are assigned to dynamic variables at each time interval to study the microscopic and dynamic behavior of various systems on the principles of Monte Carlo simulation. Here each element is characterized by slip probability and strength parameter 's'. The concept of transfer of load to neighboring sites when slip occurs i.e. load shedding is considered.<br><br>
2.The model assumes that strain hardening and recovery processes can be ignored for small strain regime and materials with low hardening rates, that obstacle density and its behavior does not change during the deformation process and that materials respond to plastic deformation similarly because the observed behavior is due to a large number of discrete events coupled through load transfer.
